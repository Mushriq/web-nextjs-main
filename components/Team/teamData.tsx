    paragraph: "Mushriq completed his graduate studies at the University of Toronto in the Developmental & Stem Cell Biology program at the Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto). Moving to the Broad Institute as postdoc, he honed his computational skills to harness existing cancer datasets to formulate hypotheses for rare diseases. Now leading the HTS team, he is excited to apply this experience in building and harnessing next-generation biomedical datasets to tackle rare and underrepresented diseases. Mushriq is passionate about teaching and he is happiest when there's a whiteboard and a marker nearby.",
